# Useful Snippets
## A collection of code-snippets, cheat-sheets and tools
Surfing the web has often exposed me to little-yet-significant hacks and scripts, which, although, were not important to me then, seemed to be so in the near future.

And that's when I decided to **collect and store** such snippets for making my (and others ;) ) programming-life a bit easier - and also for future reference.

The *collection* currently houses these snippets:

*   **CryptoSuite**
    *   *bi-croot* : Racket script to find the cube root of very large integers by bisection method
    *   *croot* : Same as above, but using Newton's method
    
*   **Linux**
    *   *Basic git commands for beginners*
    *   *Common sed scripts*
    *   *Vim cheat-sheet*
    *   *Basic terminal commands for beginners*
    
*   **Miscellaneous**
    *   *install-opencv* : A bash script to download, configure and install OpenCV and other dependencies for Ubuntu
