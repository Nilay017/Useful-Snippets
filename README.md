# Useful Snippets
## A collection of code-snippets, cheat-sheets and tools
Surfing the web has often exposed me to little-yet-significant hacks and scripts, which, although, were not important to me then, seemed to be so in the near future.

And that's when I decided to **collect and store** such snippets for making my (and others :wink:) programming-life a bit easier - and also for future reference.

The *collection* currently houses these snippets:

*   **CryptoSuite**
    *   *[bi-croot](bi-croot.rkt)* : Racket script to find the cube root of very large integers by bisection method
    *   *[croot](croot.rkt)* : Same as above, but using Newton's method
    *   *[crypto_math](crypto_math.py)* : A Python-file containing common Cryptography-related algorithms
    
*   **Linux**
    *   *[Basic git commands for beginners](basic_git.pdf)*
    *   *[Common sed scripts](sed_commands.pdf)*
    *   *[Vim cheat-sheet](vim_cheat_sheet.pdf)*
    *   *[Basic terminal commands for beginners](linux_commands.pdf)*
    
*   **Miscellaneous**
    *   *[install-opencv](install-opencv.sh)* : A bash script to download, configure and install OpenCV and other dependencies for Ubuntu
    *	*[get-song](get-song.py)* : A Python script to download the specified song without any hassle. It has options for manual selection as well as auto download, apart from choosing between audio and video.
